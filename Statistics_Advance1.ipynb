        "\n",
        "* A random variable is a variable that takes numerical values determined by the outcome of a random experiment. It maps outcomes of a sample space to real numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What are the types of random variables?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Discrete: Takes countable values (e.g., number of heads in 10 coin tosses).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Continuous: Takes any value within a range (e.g., height, weight, time).\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?**\n",

        "**4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* For continuous variables, a Probability Density Function (PDF) describes the likelihood of a variable taking a certain value. The probability is found over intervals using integrals.\n",

        "**5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* PDF: Shows the density at a point (for continuous variables).\n",
        "\n",
        "* CDF: Gives the probability that a variable is less than or equal to a specific value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* A distribution where all outcomes are equally likely (e.g., rolling a fair die).\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Two outcomes: success (1) or failure (0).\n",

        "* One trial, with success probability\n",

        "\n",
        "* Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
        "Used when there's a fixed number of identical trials, each with the same success probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Models the number of times an event occurs in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
        "Used in contexts like call arrivals or traffic flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?**\n",
        "* A distribution where all outcomes in an interval[a,b] are equally likely.\n",
        "PDF is constant: f(x)= 1/(b-a).\n",

        "**13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?**\n",
        "* States that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution.\n",

        "**14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?**\n",

        "**19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?**\n",
